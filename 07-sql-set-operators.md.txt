SET OPERATORS

Operators:
1. UNION
   - Combines results of two queries.
   - Removes duplicates automatically.

2. UNION ALL
   - Same as UNION but keeps duplicates.
   - Faster than UNION since no deduplication.

3. INTERSECT
   - Returns only rows present in both queries.

4. EXCEPT
   - Returns rows from the first query not present in the second.

Rules for Set Operators:
- Each SELECT must return the same number of columns.
- The corresponding columns must have the same or compatible data types.
- The order of columns must match between queries.
- The first query controls the column names (aliases).
- ORDER BY can only be applied once, at the very end of the combined query.
- Parentheses can be used to control precedence if mixing operators.
