# Filtering Data in SQL

Filtering lets you retrieve specific rows from a table using conditions.

## The WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause filters records that meet a specified condition.
Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

1. Common Operators in WHERE
Operator	Description	Example
=		Equal to	WHERE age = 30
<> or !=	Not equal to	WHERE age <> 30
>		Greater than	WHERE age > 25
<		Less than	WHERE age < 40
>=		Greater than or equal to WHERE age >= 18
<=		Less than or equal to    WHERE age <= 65

2. BETWEEN Operator
Selects values within a range.
Syntax:
	SELECT * FROM orders
	WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';

3. LIKE Operator and Wildcards
Used for pattern matching in text columns.

% matches zero or more characters

_ matches exactly one character

Examples:
a). SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username LIKE 'john%'; -- Starts with 'john'

b). SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username LIKE '%doe'; -- Ends with 'doe'

c). SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username LIKE '%ann%'; -- Contains 'ann'

d). SELECT * FROM products
WHERE code LIKE 'A_1'; -- 'A' followed by any one char, then '1'

4. IN Operator
Checks if a value matches any value in a list.
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE age IN (25, 30, 35);

5. IS NULL and IS NOT NULL
Filter rows where a column is or isn't NULL.

a). SELECT * FROM users
WHERE middle_name IS NULL;

b). SELECT * FROM users
WHERE middle_name IS NOT NULL;
Combining Conditions with AND, OR, NOT

6. Combining Conditions with AND, OR, NOT
a). SELECT * FROM users
WHERE age > 25 AND city = 'New York';

b). SELECT * FROM users
WHERE age < 18 OR age > 65;

c). SELECT * FROM users
WHERE NOT city = 'Chicago';
