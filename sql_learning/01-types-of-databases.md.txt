# Types of Databases

Databases are organized collections of data. There are different types of databases designed for various use cases:

## 1. Relational Databases
- Store data in tables with rows and columns.
- Use SQL for querying.
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

## 2. Key-Value Databases
- Store data as key-value pairs.
- Very fast for simple lookups.
- Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.

## 3. Document Databases
- Store data as documents (JSON, BSON).
- Flexible schemas.
- Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.

## 4. Column-Based Databases
- Store data by columns instead of rows.
- Good for analytical queries.
- Examples: Apache Cassandra, HBase.

## 5. Graph Databases
- Store data as nodes and edges.
- Useful for relationships and networks.
- Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.
